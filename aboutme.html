      <h1>Meet Mykel Luxon!</h1>
      <img src="mykel.jpg" height="250">
      <h2>I am Mykel Luxon, a 9th grader. Some of my favorite things to do include reading, cycling, and coding (a reason why I am taking this class). I am also a really good pianist.</h2>
      <h2>My goals for this unusual school year are to obtain high grades (A/Bs or As) in every course I have and to attempt to work ahead to take off as many Fridays as possible.</h2>
      <h2>I dislike most modern TV shows, movies, and music, but have little issues with most things before 2000. I hope to perform well in school and succeed as much as possible this year!
